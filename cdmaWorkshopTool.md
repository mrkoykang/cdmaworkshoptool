**FAQ**

  * Will you help me flash my phone? No. Please pay someone else that knows how if you don't.

  * Will you help me change my esn/meid? No. To the best of my knowledge this is against some FCC rules in the USA where I am located.

  * What is cdmaDevLib vs cdmaDevTerm? cdmaDevLib is a library which enables the functions in cdmaDevTerm

  * Could I please have the source code to cdmaDevTerm? of course, it is GPL v3 software. Click the source tab, and checkout from svn(I use tortoiseSvn personally)

  * Why is the code so bad? lots of reasons. But it _is_ free, open and improving slowly.

  * How can I help make cdmaDevTerm better? Many ways: report bugs, submit patches, make community content, write a walk-through, suggest features or changes

  * Why is cdmaDevTerm free? I like making free software. I use alot of free software. Although free(as in speech and beer): Please respect copyright and GPLv3, without which software like this would not be possible.

  * What features are experimental? If checked out from source and built with the debug flag set there are some features like efs which are _highly_ experimental and are really only recommended to use if you'd like to help develop these features. (if you would like a general purpose cdma program which does read efs check out bitpim or revskills)

  * What features are NOT going to happen? iPhone is probably not going to happen,(unless someone wants to submit the code) sorry.

  * Can I donate to cdmaDevTerm? For now at least there is no way to donate directly to support development effort, however, if you would like to show support: please donate to charity
